## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

	Lab 5, part 2

This is one of the lab assignments that I liked because there is a challenge of converting decimal measurements to feet, inches, and eighths of inches. I found it quite interesting while doing this assignment.

	Lab 6, part 1

This was my favorite lab because part 1 you will write a program that fills in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order. So, you can put any word that you want. It was fun.

	Lab 7, part 2

This was the second lab that I feel interesting. In part 2, you will write functions that implement the parking restriction rules on signs. This code could be used in a system that automates parking rules, such as an app that tells you where you are allowed to park, or an app that parking enforcement officers use to issue parking tickets. This feature was useful on parking rules.
